What you need to know about functions ?
	1.Assign functions to variables
	2.Define functions inside other functions
		ex:def greet(name):
			def get_message():
				return "Hello "

		result = get_message()+name
		return result

		print greet("John")
	3.Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions
		def greet(name):
			return "Hello " + name 

		def call_func(func):
			other_name = "John"
			return func(other_name)  

		print call_func(greet)

		# Outputs: Hello John
	4.Functions can return other functions
	5.Inner functions have access to the enclosing scope :
		means ..if u have written a function inside a function ,then that function has access to the parameters of the outer functions.
		even though the inner function do not have the paramters in its declaration.
